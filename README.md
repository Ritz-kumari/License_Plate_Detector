## General info
License Plate Recognition is an image-processing technology used to identify vehicles by their license plates. This technology is used in various security and traffic applications.I have made this project using Opencv and C++. ANPR consist of a camera that is linked to a computer. When a vehicle passes by the camera the camera records an image which is automatically 'read' by the computer and the vehicle registration mark (VRM) recorded.
